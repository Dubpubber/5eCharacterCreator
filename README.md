# Project Purpose
The purpose of the project is to provide the dungeons and dragons community with a free and fast tool for creating new dungeons and dragons characters for fifth edition.
# Project Authors
My name is Tyler Crowe, I'm currently a Computer Science student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I try to put aside time every week specifically for creating to further grow my skills. I've been programming for about 8 years now and have no plans on stopping now!
